#Customer-Review-Analysis

A simple dashboard-based system to analyse customer reviews and visualise insights.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
This project implements a full data analytics pipeline, designed to transform raw customer feedback into an actionable, multi-page Power BI dashboard.

The core of this project is its advanced sentiment analysis engine. Instead of relying on simple positive/negative labels, this system uses a hybrid approach:

1.  VADER Sentiment Scoring: The Python script uses the NLTK VADER library to generate a quantitative `SentimentScore` for each raw review text.
2.  Nuanced Categorization: This score is then intelligently combined with the explicit star `Rating` provided by the user (e.g., 1-5 stars). This logic creates more granular and realistic categories like "Mixed Positive" (e.g., a 4-star review with slightly negative text) and "Mixed Negative" (e.g., a 3-star review with negative text).

This enriched data is then connected to social media and conversion metrics, presenting a complete business picture in an interactive dashboard with four main views:

Overview: A high-level summary of key performance indicators, including conversion rates, social media engagement, and the average customer sentiment rating.
Conversion Details: A drill-down into the customer journey funnel, showing how product conversion rates correlate with different customer actions.
Social Media: Visualizes social media engagement (Views, Clicks, Likes), allowing for analysis of content performance over time and by product.
Customer Review Details: The primary sentiment analysis view. This tab provides a detailed breakdown of review categories, correlates sentiment scores with user ratings in a scatter plot, and allows for drilling down to read the original feedback.
